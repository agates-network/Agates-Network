# 1. Prologue
## 1.1 What happened?
1000 BC. Slave Society.  
While the slave owners were drinking wine and eating meat in the warm palace, the slaves were enduring hunger and cold, and were forced to plant crops in the vast fields.   
Unfortunately, Their hard work did not bring them warmth and prosperity, However, they received only meager sustenance. The majority of the fruits of the slaves' labor were confiscated by the slave owners to maintain their prosperous lifestyles.

In the year 1000 AD, during the feudal society, farmers emerged from their modest wooden houses constructed with planks and thatch. They toiled diligently under the relentless sun using hoes and sickles.   
Unfortunately, the land they cultivated wasn't theirs; it belonged to the feudal lords. Apart from paying rent to the landowner and substantial taxes to the government, the income from their labor barely covered their necessities for the next day's work.

In the 1800s, during the industrial society, little had changed. Workers labored over 12 hours daily in cramped, noisy, and perilous factories, earning paltry wages insufficient to afford decent shelter and basic food.   
Meanwhile, the products of their labor generated immense wealth, providing capitalists with luxurious lives.
## 1.2 What's happening?
In 2020 AD, amid a highly developed internet technology era, have things gotten better? 

While people engage extensively in online activities, browsing, posting, liking, commenting, sharing, chatting, shopping, gaming, and learning， the content they create contributes to the vast revenues of internet giants.   
Unfortunately, despite being the original creators of these revenues, users often don't see a direct impact on their wallets. The monetization occurs through various forms like advertising, e-commerce, and paid services. However, the revenue generated from user activities on the internet often doesn't directly benefit users, leading to a disconnect between user participation and financial benefit.

As of August 2023, the market values of leading internet companies illustrate the vast wealth concentrated in these corporations.   
Here are the market values of some prominent companies:
> * Alphabet(Google)   $1.648 Trillion
> * Amazon: 				$1.474 Trillion
> * Meta (Facebook): 		$819.32 Billion
> * Tencent: 				$379.41 Billion
> * Alibaba: 				$221.06 Billion

These figures highlight the substantial market values of these tech giants. 

The average annual income figures for employees at leading internet companies in 2021 were as follows:
> * Alphabet (Google): 		$295,884
> * Meta (Facebook): 		$292,785
> * Twitter: 				$232,626
> * Microsoft: 				$176,858

These figures show that employees of leading Internet companies are receiving much higher wages than ordinary workers. 

Indeed, the CEO salaries for the year 2021 were notably substantial:
> * Andy Jassy (Amazon CEO): 		$212.7 Million
> * Tim Cook (Apple CEO): 			$98.78 Million
> * Satya Nadella (Microsoft CEO): 	$49.85 Million
> * Parag Agrawal (Twitter CEO): 		$30.35 Million
> * Mark Zuckerberg (Meta CEO): 		$28.82 Million

It seems that the answer is clear:
The income generated by users' time spent does not find its way into their wallets; instead, it transforms into the market value of internet companies and the annual salary packages of their executives and employees.

**Is this fair?**

Certainly, compassionate individuals may argue that while internet companies consume users' time, they also offer various services such as information retrieval, news reading, and social interaction for free.  

If this makes sense, then:  
Slave owners might assert: "We provided shelter and food for our slaves."   
Feudal lords could argue: "We provide land and security for farmers."   
Similarly, factory owners might claim: "We provide jobs and income for workers." 

Nevertheless, regardless of their defenses, they cannot conceal the reality: they leveraged their advantageous positions to seize the labor income of workers, channeling it into their own interests and creating extreme unfairness.

## 1.3 What's about to happen?
Certainly, the world undergoes constant change, and unfair situations are not permanent.  
Consider this: if a worker lived in the United Kingdom in the early 18th century, their living conditions would likely be extremely challenging. However, if that same worker lived in the United States in the mid-to-late 20th century, their life could be characterized by abundance, sunshine, and joy.

**What prompted this transformation?**

In the contemporary world, where the distribution of Internet benefits is highly unbalanced, the possibility of transformation still exists. Technological progress and worker unity remain pivotal factors.   
Advances in technology can enhance efficiency and productivity, leading to an increased abundance of resources. Additionally, worker unity, through initiatives like forming trade unions, advocating for better wages and benefits, can work towards fostering a more equitable distribution of interests in society.   
The ongoing evolution of technology and collective efforts by workers may contribute to addressing the current imbalances in the distribution of Internet benefits.

Indeed, leveraging two key elements can facilitate this change.
  
First: Utilizing cutting-edge technology, specifically blockchain technology.   
The advantages of blockchain, including decentralization, immutability, transparent transactions, speed, and cost-effectiveness, can play a crucial role.  

Second: Fostering unity.   
Blockchain's "decentralization" feature has the potential to shift the global internet from the centralized Web 2.0 to the decentralized Web 3.0. This transformation allows every internet user to become an independent node within the network, holding an equal status without being tied to a specific center, as the blockchain operates without a centralized authority.
Simultaneously, its "non-tampering" and "transaction transparency" features can accurately record all users' various behaviors on the chain. Subsequently, the system can calculate the value of each user's contribution to the entire ecosystem.   
These values can serve as "proof of equity" to guide the fair distribution of network benefits to users.

Certainly, the progress of blockchain technology, while significant, cannot substitute for the crucial importance of "unity."   
The influence of each individual is limited, and major social changes typically arise only when countless individuals unite into cohesive "groups." 
History has repeatedly demonstrated the transformative power of collective action.

The above is our original intention to launch the Agates Network project.  
That's why our action slogan for this project is:  
> **Global Internet Benefit Redistribution Movement**

# 2. Project Introduction
## 2.1 Overview
The advent of blockchain technology, marked by features such as decentralization, non-tamperability, and transparent transactions, is poised to instigate profound changes across various fields.   
Beyond being a technological upgrade, it signifies an evolution in social organizational forms, offering new possibilities for building trust, enhancing efficiency, and fostering social equity.

The Agates Network blockchain stands out as one of the most innovative, reform-minded, and exploratory projects. Functioning as a global internet benefit distribution solution, it harnesses the potential of blockchain technology.  

By leveraging the advanced features of blockchain and incorporating them into the internet product business model, the project is dedicated to constructing a decentralized, transparent, and shared ecosystem, ensuring every participant can reap its benefits.

The plan involves establishing a global decentralized node network to offer reliable technical support for all Agates Network products and services.   
Within this network, the AGAT coin serves as the fundamental unit of value, circulating freely throughout the Agates Network and undertaking essential roles in value transmission and exchange.   
This system aims to provide users with a broader spectrum of opportunities for value interaction and participation.
## 2.2 Background
In the 2020s, technological advancements and increased productivity since the end of World War II, especially in Internet and artificial intelligence technologies over the past 30 years, have propelled humanity into the AI era.   
However, despite these strides, living standards for much of the global population haven't significantly improved compared to 30 years ago.

One contributing factor to this issue lies in the monopoly position of certain leading Internet platforms.   
Capital advantages, first-mover benefits, and network effects have enabled them to swiftly amass a vast user base, establishing dominant market positions.   Through unique business models, these platforms convert users' time and energy into substantial commercial gains, absorbing a significant portion of real industry profits.   
This monopoly not only fosters unfair market competition but also exacerbates wealth concentration, widening the gap between the rich and the poor.  

We believe that blockchain technology serves as an ideal solution to these challenges. Its decentralized, transparent, and tamper-resistant characteristics provide unique advantages in addressing issues related to Internet interest monopoly and wealth differentiation.

* Indeed, blockchain is a decentralized technology where data is distributed across multiple nodes on the network, avoiding control by a single entity. This stands in stark contrast to traditional centralized Internet platforms that can form monopolies by overseeing substantial amounts of user data. The decentralized nature of blockchain helps eliminate single points of failure and discourages excessive control by individual entities, effectively disrupting monopolistic tendencies in the network.
* The technical characteristics of blockchain allow all users to access complete transaction history and data records, and have complete data control. Users’ data is stored on the blockchain, and they can choose which platforms they share it with and have the ability to revoke authorization at any time. This will help alleviate the problem of Internet platforms abusing user data and avoid the formation of data monopolies.
* Blockchain platforms utilize coins as a measure of value and a tool to motivate users. By incentivizing users to contribute to the network, a more decentralized and equitable ecosystem can be established. The active involvement of users has the potential to undermine the platform's capacity to dominate the market through imposed rules, fostering a more dynamic and participatory environment.
* Blockchain technology has the potential to foster the development of distributed autonomous organizations (DAOs), leading to the decentralization of social organizations and decision-making processes. This facilitates broader participation by users in community affairs, mitigates the concentration of power, and enhances the fairness and democratic nature of decision-making within these organizations.

The advanced features highlighted in blockchain technology have provided a clear direction for us on how to construct a decentralized, transparent, shared, and universally beneficial Agates blockchain Network.

The chapter is designed to articulate the principles that underlie our vision for Agates Network, emphasizing the significance of promoting equality, fairness, and global harmony in the digital domain.
## 11.1 Equality for All
Agates Network staunchly adheres to the core value of "Equality for All," aiming to establish an open and egalitarian digital ecosystem. The firm conviction is that in the digital age, everyone should enjoy equal opportunities and rights, a principle woven seamlessly throughout the entirety of the Agates Network project.

In the Agates Network ecosystem, every user, irrespective of nationality, color, gender, age, or education, is considered an equal member. Our endeavor is to eliminate inequalities in the digital realm, forging a genuinely open and barrier-free network environment through the utilization of blockchain technology.

Our foremost principle is non-discrimination, ensuring that users, regardless of their location or cultural background, receive fair treatment on the Agates Network platform. Beyond being a mere project, Agates Network is a global community that unites diverse cultures, transcending digital boundaries and offering equal opportunities for users worldwide to participate.

Secondly, our emphasis lies on providing equal opportunities for participation. Each user is afforded an equal chance to engage in decision-making, contribute suggestions, and voice opinions. We actively encourage users to express their perspectives and actively participate in the governance and development of the project, ensuring that every voice is accorded equal consideration.

Our commitment is to narrow the digital divide, ensuring that all users equally reap the benefits of Agates Network. By reducing the barriers to entry for digital technology, we strive to enable more people to effortlessly engage in the digital economy and partake in the dividends ushered in by digitalization.

In the Agates Network project, users are only required to provide their nationality, excluding any other personal information, including email addresses. While users have the option to set a personalized avatar, it's not obligatory. We firmly believe that true "equality for all" is attainable only when "anonymity" is safeguarded.   
This design is geared towards enabling users to equally partake in platform activities and decision-making with anonymity as a foundation. Through this principle, we are dedicated to shaping a more just, open, and genuinely equal digital era.
## 11.2 Fair Return
In the philosophy of Agates Network, we hold the belief that the world, particularly the Internet sphere, evolves through user contributions.  
Hence, in the project's development, the distribution of benefits is envisioned to be fair and equal, aligning with each user's contribution to the Agates Network project.

In this era of globalization, the pursuit of fair returns extends beyond specific fields, becoming a driving force for the overall development of the world. Whether in the realm of the Internet or across various social levels, the principle of fair returns plays a crucial role in fostering stable and sustainable growth in society.

Primarily, we staunchly believe that user contribution is pivotal to the project's success. Agates Network is not merely a technological platform; it is a digital ecosystem constructed by users. Each user is an integral part of the system, collectively fostering the project's development through their active participation and contributions. Whether engaging in community governance, offering valuable suggestions, or bringing in new users through promotion, every contribution holds significance in the prosperity of the project.

Secondly, we regard rewards as a mutual contract. In the Agates Network project, we not only acknowledge each user's contributions but also ensure they receive commensurate rewards. This return extends beyond the project itself, encompassing the individual benefits of users. Through a rational incentive mechanism, we intricately link users' contributions with their personal interests, establishing an equitable contract between contribution and return.

The Agates Network project utilizes blockchain technology for a transparent and traceable incentive mechanism. Contributions from each user are recorded on the non-tamperable blockchain, ensuring fair protection of contributors' rights and interests. This approach not only encourages more active user participation but also establishes a virtuous cycle, fostering the sustainable development of the project.

We encourage users to engage in governance decisions, provide suggestions, share experiences, and recognize their individual value through these contributions. Each user has the chance to attain significant returns through the Agates Network project, with these returns fully reflecting their unique contributions to the project's development.

In the realm of Agates Network, fair returns are not merely a commitment but also the cornerstone of the project's sustainable development. Establishing an ecosystem where contributions and rewards are equitable, we aim to create a genuinely just and fair digital era for users.
## 11.3 Global Harmony
Human society has grappled with the enduring pain and friction stemming from inequality. Disparities among regions, countries, and groups have fueled numerous wars and conflicts, ensnaring humanity in an unending vicious cycle. Against this historical backdrop, the Agates Network team embraces the ideal of "Global Harmony" (i.e. 天下大同) and is devoted to addressing the issue of inequality, striving to create a world characterized by harmonious coexistence.

The understanding that inequality serves as the root cause of war is well-founded. Throughout history, many conflicts have arisen from competition for resources, geopolitical tensions, and unequal social structures. To attain peace and avert conflicts, it is imperative to fundamentally address the existence of inequality.  
The vision of Agates Network is to foster the redistribution of Internet interests and achieve a balanced distribution of resources and opportunities through blockchain technology and a decentralized ecosystem. This pursuit aims to create a fair environment where everyone can pursue their dreams.

We believe that realizing world harmony hinges on promoting the principles of openness and sharing. By employing blockchain technology, we can construct a transparent and non-discriminatory ecosystem, offering equal participation opportunities for individuals worldwide.  
In the realm of Agates Network, everyone can actively partake in shared resources, contribute to common decision-making, and collectively shape a shared future.
We firmly believe that collaborative endeavors can dismantle traditional inequalities, giving rise to an ideal world marked by unity.

Agates Network is committed to perpetually upholding the core values of Equality of All, Fair Return, and Global Harmony. We will tirelessly strive to construct a world that is harmonious, prosperous, and mutually beneficial. This represents our vision for the future and our responsibility for the destiny of humankind.

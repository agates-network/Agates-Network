# Agates Network Staking Policy

## 1. Introduction
1. AGAT Staking offers an opportunity for users who support the vision of the Agates Network to actively participate in its development and benefit from its growth.  
2. Participants in AGAT Staking can earn additional exclusive benefits by staking a certain amount of cryptocurrency to the Agates Network. These benefits include Credited AGAT, USDT Allowances, and other forms of compensation, as well as exclusive privileges.

## 2. Participation Eligibility
1. To ensure all participants genuinely support the Agates Network and believe in its potential for success, all participants must meet the following requirements:
	* Hold at least 10,000 Credited AGAT in the Agates Wallet.
	* Reach at least 10 referrals.
2. Additionally, all participants must ensure their staking activities comply with the legal and regulatory requirements of their respective countries.

## 3. Staking Amount
1. **Staking Currencies:**  Currently, AGAT Staking supports only USDT, with plans to support additional currencies as needed.
2. **Staking Amount:**  The minimum staking amount is 10 USDT, and the maximum is 5,000 USDT.

## 4. Staking Benefits

1. **One-time AGAT Reward:** Upon the activation of each AGAT Staking, the staker will immediately receive an AGAT reward. The reward amount is calculated as: `Staking Amount * 10% / AGAT Current Value`. The AGAT Current Value is determined by the Agates Network project based on its development and market circulation. For AGAT Current Value information, please contact the official customer service of Agates Network.

2. **Weekly AGAT Airdrop:** During the effective period of each AGAT Staking, stakers will receive a fixed amount of AGAT airdrops weekly. The airdrop amount is calculated as: `Staking Amount / (AGAT Current Value * 25)`  As above, AGAT Current Value information is available from the official customer service of Agates Network. Please note: The weekly AGAT Airdrop amount is fixed at the time the AGAT Staking takes effect, and will not change regardless of fluctuations in AGAT's value.

3. **Exclusive Staking Allowance:** Throughout the staking period, stakers will receive a Staking Allowance regularly (usually every 1-2 months). The total Staking Allowance amount is 20% of the total benefit of the Agates Network project during the rewarding period. The specific amount each staker receives depends on their total staking amount and duration. Detailed descriptions of the Staking Allowance can be found on the Wallet page of the Agates Network application.

4. **More Mining Rewards:** Thanks to the Weekly AGAT Airdrop, stakers will receive more Mining Rewards regularly (usually every 1-2 weeks). Detailed descriptions of Mining Rewards can be found on the Wallet page of the Agates Network application.

5. **More Holding Dividends:** Thanks to the Weekly AGAT Airdrop again, stakers will receive more Holding Dividends regularly (usually every 1-2 months). Detailed descriptions of Holding Dividends can be found on the Wallet page of the Agates Network application.

6. **Additional Exclusive Privileges:** These include Withdrawal Priority, Exchange Priority, DAPP Priority, Partner Qualifications, and more. Detailed information about these exclusive privileges can be found on the Staking page of the Agates Network application.


## 5. Term and Release

1. According to the roadmap of the Agates Network project and the anticipated timeline for AGAT being listed on exchanges, the Agates Network team has set the staking period for AGAT Staking to be between 6 and 24 months.

2. Any of the stakings cannot be released within the first 6 months from the date of effectiveness.

3. After 6 months from the effective date of each staking, the staker can choose to release it at any time, but Agates Network will deduct a proportion of the staking amount  as early release fee based on the staking duration, as follows:
	* For stakings of more than 6 months but less than 12 months, the early release fee will be 40% of the total staking amount.
	* For stakings of more than 12 months but less than 18 months, the early release fee  will be 30% of the total staking amount.
	* For stakings of more than 18 months but less than 24 months, the early release fee  will be 20% of the total staking amount.
	* For stakings of more than 24 months, the release fee  will be 10% of the total staking amount.

4. From the effective date of each staking, if AGAT gets listed on exchanges within 24 months, the staker can choose one of the following two options:
	* 100% redemption of all staked cryptocurrencies in order of the taking-effect date of each staking.
	* Conversion of all staked cryptocurrencies into AGAT at 10% of the AGAT market price.

5. Regardless of the staking release situation, the stakers will no longer receive the corresponding staking benefits. However, any AGAT and USDT benefits obtained during the staking period will remain with the staker and will not be affected in any way.

## 6. Participation Method
1. The Agates Network team plans to release the online staking feature along with the Agates KYC feature once the user base reaches 100,000. Eligible users can then complete AGAT Staking within the Agates Network application.  
2. Prior to this, interested users who meet the eligibility requirements can participate by emailing ceo@agates.ai with their Agates ID, staking amount, personal name, nationality, residence, and corresponding identity documents.

## 7. Special Instructions
1. Crypto staking is a common beneficial mechanism in blockchain industry. Participants should understand the detailed rules and potential risks associated with staking. The unique aspect of AGAT Staking is that all AGAT Staking participants will regularly receive USDT or other forms of benefits to mitigate potential risks.  
2. The Agates Network DAO will periodically propose and implement rule adjustments based on project needs, subject to approval by the Management Committee.

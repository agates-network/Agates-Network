# Agates Network Application Guidelines
## 1. About AGAT
AGAT is the fundamental unit for benefit distribution in Agates Network project.  

Agates Network ensures equitable benefit distribution based on users' contributions to its growth to foster participant enthusiasm, community prosperity, and the project's overall health. 

AGAT serves as both proof of contribution for diverse user roles within the project and an equity certificate, allowing users to reap corresponding rewards from the rapid growth of the Agates Network project.

When he/she gets Credited AGAT through Daily Mining, Purchasing or AGAT Staking, an equal amount of your Crediting AGAT will be automatically converted into Credited AGAT in your Agates Wallet, until all of the 5,000 Crediting AGAT are converted.

## 5. Staking Guideline

* AGAT Staking is a way to support the development of Agates Network by staking cryptocurrency in the early stages of the project, and to obtain long-term, sustainable and considerable benefits from the rapid growth of Agates Network.
* Each AGAT Staking participant (AGAT Staker) needs to pledge a certain amount of cryptocurrency (currently USDT is supported, and more cryptocurrencies will be supported in the future) to Agates Network to be eligible to receive exclusive benefits and privileges from Agates Network.
* Each AGAT Staking will bring the following benefits to its AGAT Staker:
  * **A certain amount of AGAT coins every week** The specific AGAT amount is directly proportional to the staking amount. You will find the detailed data about the staking amount and the number of AGAT coins you will receive on the AGAT Staking page of Agates Network App.
  * **Higher amounts of Mining Reward and AGAT Holding Dividend** because these two reward amounts are proportional to the number of AGAT coins you newly mine or hold respectively.
  * **Exclusive and considerable Staking Allowance** You will find the detailed description of Staking Allowance in the AGAT Staking page of Agates Network App.
  * **Many other exclusive benefits and privileges** You will find more detailed descriptions in the AGAT Staking page of Agates Network App.
* Each user can participate in AGAT Staking multiple times, and the above benefits for each AGAT Staking will be calculated separately based on the respective take-effect time.
* The staking period of AGAT Stake starts when each pledge takes effect and ends when the Agates mainnet is released. When the Agates mainnet is released, AGAT Stakers can choose to release all the pledged cryptocurrencies in order, or exchange all pledged cryptocurrencies for equivalent AGAT coins at 10% of the AGAT market price.
* In addition, every core user who recognizes the values and ideals of the Agates Network project can earn Referral Staking Reward of up to 20% of the total staking amount in batches by promoting AGAT Staking.
* Staking is a common benefit mechanism in blockchain projects. The unique feature of AGAT Staking is that during the staking period, AGAT Stakers will regularly receive benefits in the form of USDT or others as hedge for any potential risks.

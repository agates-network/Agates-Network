# Agates Network Staking Policy

## 1. Introduction
* AGAT Staking offers an opportunity for users who support the vision of the Agates Network to actively participate in its development and benefit from its growth.  
* Participants in AGAT Staking can earn additional exclusive benefits by staking a certain amount of cryptocurrency to the Agates Network. These benefits include Credited AGAT, USDT Allowances, and other forms of compensation, as well as exclusive privileges.

## 2. Participation Eligibility

	* Hold at least 50,000 Credited AGAT in the Agates Wallet.
	* Reach at least 10 valid referrals.
* Additionally, all participants must ensure their staking activities comply with the legal and regulatory requirements of their respective countries.

## 3. Staking Amount
* **Cryptocurrencies**  Currently, AGAT Staking supports only USDT, with plans to support additional currencies as needed.
* **Staking Amount**  The minimum staking amount is 10 USDT, and the maximum is 5,000 USDT.

## 4. Staking Benefits
* **Extra Credited AGAT**  All participants receive a fixed amount of Credited AGAT each week. The amount of AGAT is proportional to the staking amount and inversely proportional to the real-time price of AGAT coins at the time of staking. Detailed information on staking amounts and corresponding AGAT amounts can be obtained from Agates Networkâ€™s customer service.

## 5. Staking Period and Release
* The minimum period for each staking is 6 months, with the maximum period is until the launch of Agates Mainnet.  
* Upon the launch of the Agates Mainnet, all AGAT Staking participants can choose to redeem their staked cryptocurrencies according to the order in which the staking takes effect or exchange them for AGAT coins at 10% of the prevailing market price of AGAT.  
* PParticipants can opt for early release after 6 months. However, a 50% early release fee will be deducted from the staked amount, and participants will forfeit any future staking rewards. However, the benefits already obtained by participants before the release will not be affected in any way.

## 6. Participation Method
* The Agates Network team plans to release the online staking feature along with the Agates KYC feature once the user base reaches 100,000. Eligible users can then complete AGAT Staking within the Agates Network application.  
* Prior to this, interested users who meet the eligibility requirements can participate by emailing ceo@agates.ai with their Agates ID, staking amount, personal name, nationality, residence, and corresponding identity documents.

## 7. Special Instructions

The unique aspect of AGAT Staking is that all AGAT Staking participants will regularly receive USDT or other forms of benefits to mitigate potential risks.

## 4. Incentives
### 4.1. Rewards
*For ease of understanding, the following uses "**A** invites **B**, **B** invites **C**, **C** invites **D**, ..." as example*

1. When **A** invites **B** to register for an Agates ID, and **B** mines a total of **1,000 Credited AGAT** through Daily Mining, Mining Bonus, and Referral Mining Bonus, **B** will be counted as a "valid referral" for **A**.
2. When **A** successfully invites **B**, **A** will receive 0.02 USDT as referral reward.
3. When **B** successfully invites **C**, **A** will receive 0.01 USDT as referral reward, while **B** receives 0.02 USDT at the same time.
4. When **C** successfully invites **D**, **A** will receive 0.005 USDT as referral reward, while **B** receives 0.01 USDT, and **C** receives 0.02 USDT at the same time.

### 4.1. Examples
1. If **A** invites 20 **B** in total, each **B** invites 20 **C** in average, and each **C** invites 20 **D** in average, then, **A** will receive:
>20 * 0.02 + 20 * 20 * 0.01 + 20 * 20 * 20 * 0.005 = 44.4 USDT (2.22 USDT per referral for **A**)
2. If **A** invites 30 **B** in total, each **B** invites 30 **C** in average, and each **C** invites 30 **D** in average, then, **A** will receive:
>30 * 0.02 + 30 * 30 * 0.01 + 30 * 30 * 30 * 0.005 = 144.6 USDT (4.82 USDT per referral for **A**)
3. If **A** invites 50 **B** in total, each **B** invites 50 **C** in average, and each **C** invites 50 **D** in average, then, **A** will receive:
>50 * 0.02 + 50 * 50 * 0.01 + 50 * 50 * 50 * 0.005 = 651 USDT (13.02 USDT per referral for **A**)
4. If **A** invites 100 **B** in total, each **B** invites 100 **C** in average, and each **C** invites 100 **D** in average, then, **A** will receive:
>100 * 0.02 + 100 * 100 * 0.01 + 100 * 100 * 100 * 0.005 = 5102 USDT (51.02 USDT per referral for **A**)
      
### 4.3. Withdrawal
All referral rewards will be deposited into the withdrawable USDT account in each participant's Agates Wallet every day based on the participant's actual invitation performance.

These rewards can be withdrawn to personal wallet at any time according to the withdrawal rules.

## 5. Participating Process
1. Complete registration for Agates Network and obtain your unique referral link with your Agates ID (which is also your invitation code) in the Invite page.
2. Send invitations to your friends, ensuring that the invitation includes your own referral link.
3. You can also post the invitation on your social media accounts or in any groups.
4. When someone registers for Agates Network using your referral link or installs the Agates Network app and fills in your Agates ID in the "Inviter's Agates ID" field during registration, your invitation is complete!

## 6. Campaign Period
1. **Start Date**: The campaign begins after the Agates Network application completes testing and is officially released to global users on Google Play.
1. **End Date**: The campaign ends **3 months** after the start date or once the goal of **200,000** valid global registrations is achieved, whichever comes first.

## 7. Anti-cheat
The Agates Network team will use various technical means to monitor the behavior of each Agates ID to determine whether they are real users.

Any Agates ID found to be a fake account will NOT be counted as a "valid referral".

Any participant found to have a large number of fake invitations will be disqualified from the campaign and all issued rewards will be deducted and recovered.

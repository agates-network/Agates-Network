## 4. Incentives
### 4.1. USDT Rewards
#### 4.1.1. Rules
*For ease of understanding, the following uses "**A** invites **B**, **B** invites **C**, **C** invites **D**, ..." as example*

1. When **A** invites **B** to register for an Agates ID, and **B** mines a total of **1,000 Credited AGAT** through Daily Mining, Mining Bonus, and Referral Mining Bonus, **B** will be counted as a "valid referral" for **A**.
2. When **A** successfully invites **B**, **A** will receive 0.025 USDT as referral reward.
3. When **B** successfully invites **C**, **A** will receive 0.01 USDT as referral reward, while **B** receives 0.025 USDT at the same time.
4. When **C** successfully invites **D**, **A** will receive 0.005 USDT as referral reward, while **B** receives 0.01 USDT, and **C** receives 0.025 USDT at the same time.

#### 4.1.2. Examples
1. If **A** invites 20 **B** in total, each **B** invites 20 **C** in average, and each **C** invites 20 **D** in average, then, **A** will receive:
>20 × 0.025 + 20 × 20 × 0.01 + 20 × 20 × 20 × 0.005 = 44.5 USDT (2.225 USDT per referral for **A**)
2. If **A** invites 30 **B** in total, each **B** invites 30 **C** in average, and each **C** invites 30 **D** in average, then, **A** will receive:
>30 × 0.025 + 30 × 30 × 0.01 + 30 × 30 × 30 × 0.005 = 144.75 USDT (4.825 USDT per referral for **A**)
3. If **A** invites 50 **B** in total, each **B** invites 50 **C** in average, and each **C** invites 50 **D** in average, then, **A** will receive:
>50 × 0.025 + 50 × 50 × 0.01 + 50 × 50 × 50 × 0.005 = 651.25 USDT (13.025 USDT per referral for **A**)
4. If **A** invites 100 **B** in total, each **B** invites 100 **C** in average, and each **C** invites 100 **D** in average, then, **A** will receive:
>100 × 0.025 + 100 × 100 × 0.01 + 100 × 100 × 100 × 0.005 = 5102.5 USDT (51.025 USDT per referral for **A**)

### 4.2. AGAT Rewards
1. During this **Agates Network Referral Boost** campaign, each time one of your referrals meets the "valid referral" requirements(mines a total of **1,000 Credited AGAT** through Daily Mining, Mining Bonus, and Referral Mining Bonus), you will instantly receive an additional 1,000 Credited AGAT as a reward.
2. For each new user you invite, you will immediately receive 5,000 Crediting AGAT. These 5,000 Crediting AGAT will gradually convert into Credited AGAT as the new user progresses in their mining activities. Please refer to the "Referral Mining Bonus" section in the "How to mine?" rules in the App for more details.
3. The more Credited AGAT you mine, the more USDT rewards you will earn through various activities such as Mining Reward, Holding Dividends, and Promoting Bonus.

### 4.3. Achievement Bonus
1. Upon reaching the goal of 200,000 active users within 100 days, we will issue an additional 1,000 USDT, distributed proportionally among the top 100 promoters based on the number of invitations.
2. Upon reaching the goal of 200,000 active users within 100 days, we will airdrop an additional 100 million Credited AGAT to all active users.

### 4.4. Withdrawal
1. All rewards will be deposited into the withdrawable USDT account in each participant's Agates Wallet every day based on the participant's actual invitation performance.
2. These rewards can be withdrawn to personal wallet at any time according to the withdrawal rules.

## 5. Participating Process
1. Complete registration for Agates Network and obtain your unique referral link with your Agates ID (which is also your invitation code) in the Invite page.
2. Send invitations to your friends, ensuring that the invitation includes your own referral link.
3. You can also post the invitation on your social media accounts or in any groups.
4. When someone registers for Agates Network using your referral link or installs the Agates Network app and fills in your Agates ID in the "Inviter's Agates ID" field during registration, your invitation is complete!

## 6. Campaign Period
1. **Start Date**: The campaign begins after the Agates Network application completes testing and is officially released to global users on Google Play.
1. **End Date**: The campaign ends **100 days** after the start date or once the goal of **200,000** valid global registrations is achieved, whichever comes first.

## 7. Anti-cheat
The Agates Network team will use various technical means to monitor the behavior of each Agates ID to determine whether they are real users.

Any Agates ID found to be a fake account will NOT be counted as a "valid referral".

Any participant found to have a large number of fake invitations will be disqualified from the campaign and all issued rewards will be deducted and recovered.
